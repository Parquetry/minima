My first creative experiences began at the intersection of digital subcultures and IRL moments. Growing up in the hinterlands of the Miami metropolitan area and 
being relegated to private schools, gifted classes, and magnet programs entailed a degree of estrangement from life/culture/urban society that meant I had to fashion
my own cultural identity from online reports, communities, and relationships. It meant I was often dreaming of art exhibitions and sports events, and racing down to Ft.
Lauderdale and Miami whenever I was impelled. If you look at my house from Google Maps, you can see I was on the edge of the Everglades. My neighborhood was dominated
by the HOWA board, and I lived in Florida (it’s famously flat), and the skatepark, which I visited every week, was devoid of people. So skating was also out of the question too. I took to a revolution of the mind, whatever that means. I’m still working that out. 

I come from a long line of English grocers. There's a specific grocery store in Boston UK, and it was the family business for several generations. My great great grandfather started working for the shop in his youth, and family legend says he was invited to try out for Arsenal FC but the boss wouldn't let him get time off. So, my dad and his brother were the first to break the mold, the former became a journalist for supermarket tabloids in Miami and the latter a schoolmaster in London. No doubt the consumer poetics of the supermarket left an impression on both of them. And it makes sense. I've done my share of work for supermarkets, and they're pretty fascinating places. I'm softer and not cut out for the world of tabloid journalism, so the advertising world is the perfect point of departure while still retaining my innate desire to live in the utopia that a modern supermarket represents.

I never had the money for clothes and sneakers, so my solace was in music and literature. I turned to music boards and forums, you can check out my last.fm page here, it's been scrobbling my Spotify plays for ten years – Soulseek torrents and YouTube streams are therefore not included, unfortunately. I wanted Bernie Sanders to be president, I preferred the nonhierarchical spirit of punk, rave, and Broward County rap to the high production value of mainstream rock, EDM, and Atlanta rap. I eventually realized I preferred music that was burning with life, that changes how you dress and what you dream of, and was hopefully inclusive.
