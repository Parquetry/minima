POV: Caught in a flood with a Senior Creative Director

My first creative experiences began at the intersection of digital subcultures and IRL moments. Growing up in the hinterlands of the Miami metropolitan area and being relegated to private schools, gifted classes, and magnet programs entailed a degree of estrangement from life/culture/urban society which meant I had to fashion my own cultural identity from research derived from online reports, communities, and relationships. If you look at my house from Google Maps, you can see I was on the edge of the Everglades. My neighborhood was dominated by the homeowners association, and I lived in Florida (itâ€™s famously flat), and the skatepark, which I visited every week, was devoid of people. So skating was also out of the question too. I was never in a garage/punk band either, but I did briefly form a twee/indie pop band (The Petals) and we had a few rehearsals as well as many long, in-depth discussions over Facebook Messenger about the nature and essence of music. I took to a revolution of the mind, whatever that means. 

I come from a long line of English grocers. There's a specific grocery store in Boston, England, antwarket left an impression on both of them. I've done my share of work for supermarkets, and they're pretty fascinating places. When I could've been in a masters program I chose to work in the New York City service industry where I got to hang out a lot and discover the dreams and share the memes of my generational cohort. Being underemployed for a couple of years is like doing study abroad.

If life is a journey, then creativity is a [cruising altitude](https://soundcloud.com/woodenpanelling/surfing-mp3?si=0774129d25b241049261b8a1566fb12c&utm_source=clipboard&utm_medium=text&utm_campaign=social_sharing). I never had the money for clothes and sneakers, so my solace was in the streaming of sound, image, and text. I turned to music boards and forums, you can check out my last.fm page here, it's been scrobbling my Spotify plays for ten years â€“ Soulseek torrents and YouTube plays are sadly not included.


In college I wanted Bernie Sanders to be president, I preferred the nonhierarchical spirit of punk, rave, and Broward County rap to the high production value of mainstream rock, EDM, and Atlanta rap. I eventually realized I preferred music that was burning with life, that changes how you dress and what you think about. In freshman year, my roommate was beginning his career as a graphic designer in advertising. We felt impelled to soak up as much information as possible, and six years later I realize we shared a desire to work and participate in viral events and media.
